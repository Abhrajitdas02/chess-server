</p>

PHP Ratchet WebSocket chess server using [PGN Chess](https://github.com/programarivm/pgn-chess) as its chess board representation to play chess games.

### Set Up

Create an `.env` file:

    cp .env.example .env

Bootstrap the environment:

    bash/dev/start.sh

Find out your Docker container's IP address:

    docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' pgn_chess_server_php_fpm

### Create a PGN Chess Database

	docker exec -it --user 1000:1000 pgn_chess_server_php_fpm php cli/db-create.php
	This will remove the current PGN Chess database and the data will be lost.
	Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y

### Seed the Database with Games

	docker exec -it --user 1000:1000 pgn_chess_server_php_fpm php cli/db-seed.php data/01_games.pgn
	This will search for valid PGN games in the file.
	Large files (for example 50MB) may take a few seconds to be inserted into the database.
	Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
	Good! This is a valid PGN file. 512 games were inserted into the database.
