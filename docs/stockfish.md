## Description

Outlines how to integrate and use the Stockfish chess engine in your chess application for analysis and gameplay.

## Overview

Stockfish is a renowned open-source chess engine that can be integrated into your chess application to provide strong game analysis and move suggestions. Whether you want to analyze positions, play against Stockfish, or receive recommendations for your moves, integrating Stockfish can significantly enhance the chess experience.

## Parameters
- `param1` :
- **Type**: int
- **Attributes**: constant


## Usage

Integrating Stockfish typically involves running it as a separate process and communicating with it using the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol. Here's an example of how to use Stockfish in your application:

1. **Install Stockfish:**

   Before using Stockfish, you need to install it on your system. You can download it from the [official Stockfish website](https://stockfishchess.org/download/).

2. **Run Stockfish:**

   In your PHP application, you can use the `proc_open` function or a similar method to run Stockfish as a separate process. You'll communicate with Stockfish via its standard input and output.

   Example:

   ```php
   $descriptors = [
       0 => ["pipe", "r"], // Stockfish's stdin
       1 => ["pipe", "w"], // Stockfish's stdout
   ];
   ```
    ```
   $process = proc_open('stockfish', $descriptors, $pipes);

   if (is_resource($process)) {
       // Send a UCI command to Stockfish to initialize it.
       fwrite($pipes[0], "uci\n");
       fflush($pipes[0]);

       // Read the engine's response from Stockfish's stdout.
       $response = stream_get_contents($pipes[1]);

       // Close the process when done.
       fclose($pipes[0]);
       fclose($pipes[1]);
       proc_close($process);
   }```
